## Hey, I’m Rakshith 👋  
**50% Ethical Hacker • 50% AI-Powered Indie Builder**

I’m a BCA student with a deep curiosity for both breaking and building systems.  
From testing payloads in my local hacker lab to building AI-powered tools, full-stack websites, and indie startup projects — I’m always shipping, learning, and experimenting.

### 🧠 What I Do

- 💻 Build full-stack websites & indie SaaS tools  
- 🤖 Create AI-powered utilities (like automated slide generators using n8n & LibreOffice)  
- 🧩 Tinker with no-code + low-code platforms for rapid prototyping  
- 🚀 Launch startup-style side projects — learn, build, ship, repeat  
- 🔐 Explore cybersecurity, CTFs, and exploit testing in my local lab  
- ⚙️ Automate boring tasks using scripts, APIs, and AI

### 📚 Currently Learning

- Penetration testing & ethical hacking  
- Scripting (Python, Bash, JavaScript) for automation  
- AI tool-building & no-code integrations (n8n, LangChain)  
- Networking & system internals (packet analysis, traffic inspection)

### 💬 Fun Fact

> I’m not just learning how to break into systems — I’m building the tools people *wish* they had to defend or automate them.
